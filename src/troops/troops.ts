// Barrel Module for the Feature - Troops

// A barrel's purpose is to aggregate other modules and export them. Why? Because this reduces the number of import statements you need to use the modules. To put it another way, if the Angular 2 team did not use barrels, you might have 100 import statements everywhere :) Thankfully, they use barrels such as angular2/core. In the example above, barrels are used to aggregate the heroes feature.
